**Create Colonies** is a compatibility bridge mod that connects the industrial engineering of **[Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create)** with the thriving civilizations of **[MineColonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies)**.

This project is a modern port designed for **Minecraft 1.21.1 on NeoForge**.

## 🛠 Features

### 📋 Smart Resource Management
Tired of manually checking what blocks your Builder needs?
*   **Clipboard Integration:** Right-click a MineColonies **Hut Builder** block with a **Create Clipboard**.
*   **Automatic Checklists:** The mod automatically reads the building's required resources and writes them onto the Clipboard as a checklist.
*   **Visual Tracking:** Easily track gathered materials and hand them off to your builder without switching back and forth between GUIs.

*(More integration features are planned for future updates!)*

## 📜 Credits & Inspiration

This mod stands on the shoulders of giants. It is heavily inspired by and based on the work of previous developers who pioneered Create/MineColonies compatibility:

*   **Create Colonies** by **[MotionlessTrain](https://github.com/MotionlessTrain)**: The direct predecessor to this codebase.
*   **Create Colonial** by **[Tribulla](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tribulla/projects)**: The original inspiration for bridging these two mods.

This project aims to keep their vision alive on modern Minecraft versions (1.21+ NeoForge).
